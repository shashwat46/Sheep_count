# Sheep_count
I've made use of 3 PIR sensors placed at the gate, the meadow and the paddock within an appropriate distance.
When the sensor at the gate detects motion and it is followed by motion within the padock entry, the sheep count increases by 1
When the sensor at the gate detects motion and it is followed by motion within the the field, the sheep count decreases by 1.
